# Data Engineering Assessment

Welcome!  
This exercise evaluates your core **data-engineering** skills:

| Competency | Focus                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SQL        | relational modelling, normalisation, DDL/DML scripting        |
| Python ETL | data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, & loading (ELT/ETL) |

---

## 0 Prerequisites & Setup

> **Allowed technologies**

- **Python ≥ 3.8** – all ETL / data-processing code
- **MySQL 8** – the target relational database
- **Pydantic** – For data validation
- List every dependency in **`requirements.txt`** and justify selection of libraries in the submission notes.

---

## 1 Clone the skeleton repo

```
git clone https://github.com/100x-Home-LLC/data_engineer_assessment.git
```

✏️ Note: Rename the repo after cloning and add your full name.

**Start the MySQL database in Docker:**

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.initial.yml up --build -d
```

- Database is available on `localhost:3306`
- Credentials/configuration are in the Docker Compose file
- **Do not change** database name or credentials

For MySQL Docker image reference:
[MySQL Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql)

### Problem

- You are provided with a raw JSON file containing property records is located in data/
- Each row relates to a property. Each row mixes many unrelated attributes (property details, HOA data, rehab estimates, valuations, etc.).
- There are multiple Columns related to this property.
- The database is not normalized and lacks relational structure.
- Use the supplied Field Config.xlsx (in data/) to understand business semantics.

### Task

- **Normalize the data:**

  - Develop a Python ETL script to read, clean, transform, and load data into your normalized MySQL tables.
  - Refer the field config document for the relation of business logic
  - Use primary keys and foreign keys to properly capture relationships

- **Deliverable:**
  - Write necessary python and sql scripts
  - Place your scripts in `src/`
  - The scripts should take the initial json to your final, normalized schema when executed
  - Clearly document how to run your script, dependencies, and how it integrates with your database.

## Submission Guidelines

- Edit the section to the bottom of this README with your solutions and instructions for each section at the bottom.
- Ensure all steps are fully **reproducible** using your documentation
- DO NOT MAKE THE REPOSITORY PUBLIC. ANY CANDIDATE WHO DOES IT WILL BE AUTO REJECTED.
- Create a new private repo and invite the reviewer https://github.com/mantreshjain and https://github.com/siddhuorama

**Good luck! We look forward to your submission.**

#  How to Run the ETL Pipeline

This project contains four main Python scripts inside the src/ folder:

- extract.py → Cleans and converts raw JSON → NDJSON
- transform.py → Normalizes and processes data
- load.py → Loads data into MySQL using SQLAlchemy
- main.py → Runs the entire ETL end-to-end

Before loading any data, the system automatically initializes the database schema by executing the `create_tables.sql` file.

During execution, the ETL engine:

1. Establishes a connection to the MySQL database using SQLAlchemy  
2. Reads all SQL statements from `sql/create_tables.sql`  
3. Creates every required table using `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`  
4. Ensures that the schema is ready before the loading phase begins  


STEP 1
: All dependencies are listed in src/requirements.txt
 : Install them using: pip install -r src/requirements.txt

STEP 2
: To run the complete ETL pipeline: python -m src.main

#   Database Connection
MySQL connection is created in load.py

connection_url = f"mysql+pymysql://{user}:{password}@{host}/{database}"

self.engine = create_engine(connection_url)
